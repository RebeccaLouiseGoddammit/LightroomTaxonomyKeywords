# Lightroom Taxonomy Keywords

A file with nested keywords for taxonomic identification in Adobe Lightroom, mainly focusing on birds, but includes some others like snakes,
butterflys, dragonflys and domestic pets, mostly found in Texas, and growing as I see fit.

Currently supports
* Kingdom	
* Phylum	
* Subphylum	
* Class	
* Order	
* Family	
* Genus	
* Species	

In the future may include other sub- and super- levels and tribe.
