# Lightroom Taxonomy Keywords

A file with nested keywords for taxonomic identification in Adobe Lightroom, mainly focusing on birds, but includes some others like snakes,
butterflys, dragonflys and domestic pets, mostly found in Texas, and growing as I see fit.

The keywords are nested, so that if you assign a photo with the keyword `Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis)`, it will appear in searches for 
its parents `Cardinals & Allies (Family Cardinalidae)`, `Perching Birds (Passeriformes)`, `Birds (Aves)` etc. It also adds the common 
(`Northern Cardinal`) and Latin (`Cardinalis cardinalis`) versions alone as an ailias to the full keyword.


Currently supports

* Kingdom
* Phylum
* Subphylum
* Class
* Order
* Family
* Genus
* Species

In the future may include other sub- and super- levels and tribe.

## Installation

To use these keywords in Lightroom, simply import the file with "Import Keywords..." from the "Metadata" menu in the Library view.
